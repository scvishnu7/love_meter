Have fun by finding how much your partner loves you. :-)

A very simple logic used by children.<br/>
<br/>
-> write name1 Loves name2<br/>
-> write letter repetation count from left to right.<br/>
-> fold that numbers by adding extrem left to extrem right and same on remaning upto middle.<br/>
-> repeat the proces of folding until the number become <= 100<br/>
<br/>
Ha Ha a funny way of passing time.<br/>
