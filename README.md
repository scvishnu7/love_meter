Have fun by finding how much your partner loves you. :-)

A very simple logic used by childers.
-> write name1 Loves name2
-> write letter repetation count from left to right.
-> fold that numbers by adding extrem left to extrem right and same on remaning upto middle.
-> repeat the proces of folding until the number become <= 100

Ha Ha a funny way of passing time.
